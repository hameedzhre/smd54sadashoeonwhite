    "short_description": "Train harder, move faster, and feel lighter with the On Men's Cloud X Sneakers. Born from the idea that less is more, the Cloud X is designed for athletes who need a shoe that can keep up with the most demanding workouts. It's a versatile hybrid that bridges the gap between a high-performance running shoe and a stable, flexible training shoe. The secret lies in its construction: the CloudTec? pods are positioned directly under the metatarsals, putting the cushioning exactly where you need it for explosive movements. This is combined with a unique, hollow-core Speedboard? that is both lightweight and flexible, allowing for a full range of motion during agility drills, lunges, and sprints. The result is a shoe that feels incredibly close to the ground, providing exceptional stability and feedback for strength training, while still offering the soft, responsive cushioning needed for short runs and HIIT sessions. The upper is made from a highly breathable, single-layer mesh that wraps the foot for a secure, sock-like fit. For the athlete who demands versatility without compromise, the On Men's Cloud X is the ultimate training partner, ready to take on everything from the weight room to the treadmill.",
